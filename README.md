# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

For this application I have used Material UI for the Modal dialog that will appear when clicking on the individual character because I thought modal is good way to display more detailed information

And for time calculations I have used moment, its very good package for date manipulation and showing the format in many ways

For styling I have used styled components because I believe that for React and considering using just CSS can lead to leaking of the styles to other components and many other issues with nesting
